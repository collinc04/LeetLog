/*
    Had a bit of a rough time keeping track of everything in the if statement
    and I feel like there is a better way to keep track of all of those conditions,
    I think if I re-do this problem I would use a helper method to make it a lot more
    legible. I also feel like there is probably something I could do to reduce the lines
    of code in this solution
